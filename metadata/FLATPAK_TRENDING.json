Sure, you can play board games, but why not make a house made of dice, then frisbee it with a poker chip? Draw on the table while waiting for your opponent to make a move in chess, or flip the table into deep space after losing an all-in bet? The table is your oyster!<br>You can play online with friends in the click of a button, no login or sign-up required! Simply host a game, and share the room code with your friends. You can also play singleplayer, with no internet connection required.<br>Do you have a D&amp;D campaign in mind? Want to command an army in Warhammer? Or is there another board game you want to play? Luckily, the game uses a modular and easy-to-use asset pack system that makes it really quick to import your images, models, music, and more!<br>The game is completely free to play, and the source code is available on GitHub!<br>You can also help contribute to the game! From submitting code and assets, to suggesting ideas, translating the project, or even finding bugs, there's a lot of ways that you can help make the game better and more accessible.<br>",
